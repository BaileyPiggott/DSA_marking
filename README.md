### DSA Marking

Classifying responses to the Design Skill Assessment (DSA) using text analytics. R is used to analyse text and create a matrix of word and 2-4 word phrase frequency. This matrix is written to a csv and imported in MATLAB. 

MATLAB is used to create bagged decision trees for each of the seven DSA rubric criteria (problem definition, conceptual design, preliminary design, detailed design, validation, implementation).

DSA samples are in a folder called "DSA_samples" within the project repo; samples are .txt files
